# Language-Analysis-of-Political-In-Groups

For this project I used textual analysis to classify and compare rhetoric across political affiliations. I extracted Reddit comments with API from political subreddits and applied LDA topic modeling using NRC sentiment analysis to measure difference in emotion and key words.

The goal of this project was to outline differences and similarities in rhetoric and discussion topics among both political groups.
